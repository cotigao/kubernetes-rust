The server returns only those CIDRs that it thinks that the client can match. For example: the master will return an internal IP CIDR only, if the client reaches the server using an internal IP. Server looks at X-Forwarded-For header or X-Real-Ip header or request.RemoteAddr (in that order) to get the client IP.
